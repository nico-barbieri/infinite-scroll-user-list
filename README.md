# Infinite Scroll User List

â€¢ [PREVIEW](https://nico-barbieri.github.io/infinite-scroll-user-list/)

A simple web-app to test Infinite Scroll with IntersectionObserver.
On "User List" page there's a list of users from randomuser.me and for each user there's a link to his personal page with more informations.

Used: React.js - React Router - Intersection Observer - Axios // Styled with Sass

**IMPORTANT:** *I noticed that online preview is mistakenly flagged as a phishing attempt by Avast (and maybe some other antivirus) due to the presence of front-end clones of some famous websites found in other repositories. However, it is completely safe to use, and I'm taking all necessary measures to resolve this issue as soon as possible.*
